# Payments REST API
This repo is integrated with TravisCI, with a CD pipeline which executes the isolated and end to end tests, deploying in the end to Heroku and publishing several metrics to SonarCloud and Coveralls:

* TravisCI: https://travis-ci.org/
* Heroku: https://api-pay-v1.herokuapp.com/
* SonarCloud: payments:payments-api
* Coveralls: (the coverage is only shown for the isolated tests)

## Features description
This is RESTful Payments API, where it is possible to:
* Fetch	a payment resource.	
* Create, update and delete	a payment resource
* List a collection of payment resources
* Persist resource state (currently only in memory)

## Prerequisites tu run anything locally
* You need **Java 8** and **Maven >= 3.5** installed.


## How to run the REST API server locally
1. In order to start it up, you have two options:
    * `mvn spring-boot:run`, or
    * `mvn clean package && java -jar target/payments-api-1.0.0.jar`
2. To check that it is up and running, you have two options:
    * From a web browser, access http://localhost:9000
    * From a terminal, run `curl localhost:9000`
    * In either case, you should see a "The server is up and running!" message


## Testing
You can see the resulting tests executed in TravisCI: https://travis-ci.org/

### How to run the automated tests locally
* **Isolated tests**: run `mvn clean test`
* **Sociable tests**: run `mvn clean test -PintegrationTests` (domain boundary tests)
* **End to end tests** run`mvn clean test -Pend2end` (real Spring Boot tests)
* **All tests**: run `mvn clean test -PallTests` (all the above :-) )

### Manually test
* You can import a Postman collection from here: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/d6792fd6384da2a3ed15

### Mutation testing
* Mutation testing is a good way to check how good your tests are.
* Run `mvn clean test -DwithHistory org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage` (example for isolated tests)
* You can see locally the HTML reports created under /target/pit-reports/<timestamp>


## Production environment
* You can access the app here: https://api-pay-v1.herokuapp.com
* E.g. https://api-pay-v1.herokuapp.com/v1/payments

## REST API documentation
* https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2082328/RWEauh9x#4a1f4612-7298-2a7c-b0a2-f5d57b92398c
* Next: use Swagger or something similar.

### Basic Monitoring Services
* Based in Micrometer (already included in Spring Boot).
* Some examples in local environment:
    * Health:   http://localhost:9000/monitor/health
    * Info:     http://localhost:9000/monitor/info
* Some examples in Production:
    * All the published endpoints: https://api-pay-v1.herokuapp.com/monitor
    * Health:   https://api-pay-v1.herokuapp.com/monitor/health
    * Info:     https://api-pay-v1.herokuapp.com/monitor/info
 
* More info about the endpoints:
    * https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints-exposing-endpoints


## Maven checks
* Find available plugin updates: `mvn versions:display-plugin-updates`
* Find available dependency updates: `mvn versions:display-dependency-updates`
* Generate several reports under target/site running `mvn site`
    * It generates pitest reports (mutation testing)
    * Identify dependencies with known vulnerabilities

## New things tried:
* Cucumber (from scratch)
* Papertrail logging and basic alerts
* Micrometer monitoring
* Lombok
* ModelMapper
* draw.io
